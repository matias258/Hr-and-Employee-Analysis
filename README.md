# Employee Demographics Analysis

We received a dataset containing demographic and employment-related information for employees. Using this data, we aim to analyze key trends such as income inequality, population growth, education, and health metrics. The project involves processing the data, performing transformations, and creating visualizations to derive actionable insights.

To achieve this, we will:

1. Extract the data from an Excel file and upload it to Google Cloud Storage.
2. Transform the data using Google Cloud Functions and load it into BigQuery.
3. Analyze the data by creating datasets and views in BigQuery.
4. Visualize the insights using Looker Studio to create interactive dashboards.
5. Automate the pipeline so that new data uploads trigger the entire process.
